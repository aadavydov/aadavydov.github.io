    "text": "I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at McGill University. I am a comparativist specialising in Western and Eastern Europe, particularly Russia.\nMy dissertation examines the impact of the Russian regime’s selective adoption of international radical right rhetoric on various ideological strands of the opposition. I apply computational text analysis methods to transcripts generated from audio data, such as propaganda programs and YouTube channels. I anchor these empirical approaches in a theoretical framework based on nationalism studies. Broadly, my research explores ethnic nationalism, the radical right, its tensions with the center-right, and white identity politics.\nBefore joining McGill and pursuing political science, I lectured on Western European and American cultural history and literature at Lomonosov Moscow State University. My prior work investigated American and British racial theories during the interwar period. I hold a degree in Western European Studies, with a focus on the UK and Germany.\nYou can contact me at andrey.davydov@mail.mcgill.ca.\n\n\n© Andrey Davydov 2024"
