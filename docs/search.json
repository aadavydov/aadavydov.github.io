    "text": "Welcome! I am Andrey Davydov, a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at McGill University.\nMy dissertation examines the impact of the Russian regime’s adoption of international radical right rhetoric on the diverse ideological strands of the opposition, spanning the spectrum from social liberals to the extreme right. I use computational text analysis techniques on novel datasets, which I combine with a more qualitative grounding in nationalism studies. Broadly, I am working on ethnic nationalism, the radical right, its tensions with the centre-right, and white identity. I am a comparativist specialising in Western and Eastern Europe, particularly Russia and Ukraine.\nBefore coming to McGill and turning into a political scientist, I lectured on Western European and American cultural history and literature at the Department of Foreign Languages and Area Studies at Lomonosov Moscow State University. My previous research focused on American and British racial theories in the interwar period. I hold a degree in Western European Studies.\n\n\n© Andrey Davydov 2024"
