I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/grad/current-phd-students).

My dissertation looks at the impact of the Russian regime's selective adoption of international radical right rhetoric on diverse ideological strands of the opposition. I use computational text analysis methods on transcripts generated from audio data such as propaganda programs, which I combine with a theoretical grounding in nationalism studies. Broadly, I am working on ethnic nationalism, the radical right, its tensions with the centre-right, and white identity politics. I am a comparativist specialising in Western and Eastern Europe, particularly Russia and Ukraine.

Before joining McGill and becoming a political scientist, I lectured on Western European and American cultural history and literature at the Department of Foreign Languages and Area Studies at Lomonosov Moscow State University. My previous research focused on American and British racial theories in the interwar period. I hold a degree in Western European Studies (UK and Germany).
