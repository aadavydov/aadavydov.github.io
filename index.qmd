I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/grad/current-phd-students), specialising in comparative politics with a focus on Eastern Europe, particularly Russia.

My dissertation examines how the Kremlin's adoption of foreign radical right rhetoric impacts diverse ideological strands of the public. I apply computational text analysis methods to transcripts derived from audio sources, such as propaganda talk shows and YouTube channels. I situate these empirical findings within the theoretical framework of nationalism studies. Broadly, my research explores ethnic nationalism, the tensions between the radical right and centre-right, as well as white identity politics.

Before joining McGill and pursuing political science, I lectured in Western European and American cultural history and literature at Lomonosov Moscow State University. My earlier work analysed American and British racial theories during the interwar period. I hold a degree in Western European Studies, with a concentration on the UK and Germany.
