Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at McGill University.

My dissertation, x. Broadly, I am working on ethnic nationalism, the radical right, the centre-right, and white identity with a regional focus on Western and Eastern Europe, particularly Russia and Ukraine.

Before coming to [McGill](yarrr) and turning into a political scientist, I worked at the Department of Comparative Literatures and Cultures at Lomonosov Moscow State University. My previous research focused on American and British racial theories in the interwar period. I hold an undergraduate degree in Western European Studies.
