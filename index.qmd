I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/grad/current-phd-students). I am a comparativist specialising in Western and Eastern Europe, particularly Russia.

My dissertation examines the impact of the Russian regime’s selective adoption of international radical right rhetoric on various ideological strands of the opposition. I employ computational text analysis methods on transcripts generated from audio data, such as propaganda programs and YouTube channels, combined with a theoretical grounding in nationalism studies. Broadly, my research explores ethnic nationalism, the radical right, its tensions with the center-right, and white identity politics.

Before joining McGill and pursuing a career in political science, I lectured on Western European and American cultural history and literature at Lomonosov Moscow State University. My previous research focused on American and British racial theories during the interwar period. I hold a degree in Western European Studies, with a focus on the UK and Germany.
